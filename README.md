# GIT TIPS

- git status:                     show current status of repo
- git add:                        add files to to be commited 
- git commit -m 'message here':   commit changes with meaningful message
- git log:                        shows a list of commits and descriptions

## To add a github repo
- create a new repo on github
- want to add the remote to our project on computer (git remote add origin _ssh link here_)

# Basic workflow
-------------------------------- Repeat this often --------------------------------
- try to break up the problems into simpler problems (maybe this on paper, or comments in code, or rubber ducky method)
- code one of these broken up problems 
- test and make sure that chunk is complete
- git add (files that you changed related to that chunk of work)
- git commit - m 'message describes that chunk of work'
- repeat for every problem

---

-------------------------------- with github --------------------------------
- git push origin master (when a couple of chunks are done, or when teammate needs changes)
- git pull origin master (when grabbing changes)

- later talk github
